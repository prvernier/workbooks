# Introduction

The objective of this project is to analyse movement patterns, habitat use, and functional connectivity of caribou herds intersecting the Liard First Nations (LFN) traditional territory in southeast Yukon and northcentral BC. Products will include i) a detailed report describing methods and results (this document), ii) a set of maps identifying seasonal ranges, movement corridors and habitat suitability, and iii) online apps and dashboards allowing users to further explore the results of the analyses. This is a live document that will be revised regularly as the analysis proceeds and based on feedback from collaborators.

## Objectives

The specific objectives of the project include:

-   Identify annual and seasonal ranges (population- and individual-level).
-   Identify seasonal corridors/movement paths (population- and individual-level).
-   Develop habitat models and generate predictive maps.
-   Develop resistance surfaces and generate connectivity maps.
